This repository demonstrates an unexpected type promotion behavior in Hack when mixing integer and float types in function arguments and return values.  The `bug.hh` file shows the code exhibiting the issue, and `bugSolution.hh` offers a possible solution by explicitly specifying return types to ensure type safety and predictable behavior. The issue stems from implicit type coercion which can lead to unexpected floating-point results when dealing with integer arithmetic.  This is particularly relevant when precision is critical.
